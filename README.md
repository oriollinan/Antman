# Antman

The goal of this project is to compress data.

Your antman binary is the one that will compress files. It will take two parameters. The first one is the path
to the file we want compressed. The second one is a number corresponding to the type of file it is.
Your program will then print a compressed version of the file on the standard output.

Your giantman binary is the one that will recover files from their compressed format. It will take two parameters. The first one is the path of a file containing compressed data. The second one is a number corresponding to the type of file it originaly was.
